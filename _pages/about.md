## Research Interests
My research interest lies in following areas:
- Multimodal reasoning and its applications in E-commerce domain [MIND](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10701).
- Multi-agent Interaction and collaborative reasoning, specifically, I'm interested in the collective intelligence of the agent system. [Expertise Delegation](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2505.07313)
- VLM/LLMs' social intelligence, which explores the agent's capability in interacting with the society and humanbeings.
- VLM/LLMs' reasoning ability, especially from the perspective of meta-cognition (system2 thinking and beyond)

 If you are interested in these areas, please feel free to contact me at `bxuan at connect dot ust dot hk`.
